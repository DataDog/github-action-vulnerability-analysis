# `Vulnerability Analysis` Github Action

The Datadog Github Action continuously monitors dependency and version information of code being deployed. By integrating this data with Datadog’s Continuous Profiler and Snyk’s Vulnerability database, this provides a real-time view of what code is actually accessible and vulnerable in production. By layering [Profiler data](https://app.datadoghq.com/profiling?explorerView=search) on top of [Snyk's Intel Vulnerability DB](https://snyk.io/product/vulnerability-database/), Datadog is able to provide a list of truly reachable vulnerabilities—those that are invoked by external users in production.

## Prerequisites

* Set up [Datadog Continuous Profiler](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/profiler/). A Datadog account with the Profiler enabled is required to create Datadog application and API keys and to access the Profiler. If you don't already have a Datadog account, sign up for a [Datadog Free Trial](https://www.datadoghq.com/free-datadog-trial/).
    * **Note**: When setting up Datadog Continuous Profiler, the `service` and `version` must follow the same conventions as in [unified service tagging](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tagging/unified_service_tagging/?tab=kubernetes).
* Set up Snyk. A Snyk account is required to create the Snyk token. Sign up for a free [Snyk account](https://snyk.io/signuputm_medium=Partner&utm_source=Datadog&utm_campaign=Datadog-Profiler-2020), or use an already existing account of any tier.
    * **Note**: The Snyk integration only applies to Java applications, with support for more languages coming soon.

## Setup

1. Start by setting up or adding onto an existing [Github Actions Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).
2. Next, identify the Datadog Profiling Services in Datadog where you want to set up Vulnerability Security tracking. You'll need the service name that is in the Service column of your [Datadog Profiling page](https://app.datadoghq.com/profiling).
    <img width="1205" alt="Service name" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28788585/101665423-30ef3880-3a0a-11eb-9740-2ab71d20e22a.png">
3. Define the service and the version that should be monitored and connect Datadog and Snyk to your Github Actions workflow by editing your Github Actions workflow YAML file to include the parameters `build-file`, `service`, `version`, `datadog-api-key`, `datadog-app-key`, and `snyk-token`. For a full list of fields, see [Inputs](#inputs). Here is an example yaml:

```yaml
jobs:
  vulnerability_analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Setup Node
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: 12.x
    - uses: datadog/github-action-vulnerability-analysis@master
      with:
        build-file: 'app/build.gradle'
        service: 'app-name'
        version: 'v2.1'
        datadog-api-key: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_API_KEY }}
        datadog-app-key: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_APP_KEY }}
        snyk-token: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```
4. Repeat steps 2 - 3 for any other services that you want to set up Vulnerability Security monitoring (you only need to set up `datadog-api-key`, `datadog-app-key`, and `snyk-token` once).

### Results

Once you have integrated Snyk and Datadog and run your Github Actions Workflow, you will begin to see the Snyk vulnerability analysis in the **Vulnerability Security** column on the [Datadog Profiler search page](https://app.datadoghq.com/profiling?explorerView=search) for any implemented services.

View the Profiler data on top of Snyk’s vulnerability analysis, and drill in to see a list of reachable vulnerabilities invoked by external users in production, with a description containing a link to the Snyk vulnerbility database that will give you insight into how to remediate them.

Use the [Search view](https://app.datadoghq.com/profiling?explorerView=search) to get a high level understanding of how these vulnerabilities are invoked.
